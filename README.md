# covid-19-tracker-app

Description

This is a covid-19-tracker app which shows the number of infected, recovered and dead people by the corona. In the upper part of the app, 
the cards show exactly how many people are infected, recovered or died globally. Below, the line chart shows the data globally to get more visualization. However, if we select a specific country from the countries listed, the bar charts shows the data specific to the country we selected.
